based on Size and number of bedrooms ,
my first project in mechine learning and dealing with datasets learnt by prompting and developped using jupyter lab ,
notebook in 1.5 hours with so little dataset of 100 records that to generated by gpt 3.5 , soon train and test with more data ...

Frontend is hosted by github pages and the flask backend is in the aws instance

To use and test locally , clone the repository from master branch

git clone -b master https://github.com/Anani999/HousePricePrediction

open the index.html in the chrome and run the app.py with python and install necessary dependencies (flask , numpy , pandas , sklearn )
